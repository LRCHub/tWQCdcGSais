twenty miles from anyone
set my sights on the setting sun
heaven talks but not to me
cause heaven knows that
nothing good comes tree
desolation tragedy
is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
petty lies to everyone
in the hopes that
I could be someone
heaven talks but not to me
and now I wonder
if it's meant to be
desolation tragedy
is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me
is there nothing good in me
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
but I'll take your word
cause after all
you've never lied
oh not at all
but look at me
oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things
that matter the least
oh let me have release
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
I've let me down down down down
